## Phase-by-Phase Strategy

### Early Game (Waves 1-25)

**Goals:** Establish defenses, build economy, survive to first prestige check

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Start with 2-3 Pulse Cannons near the center
2. Upgrade to level 2-3 before adding more turrets
3. Let interest accumulate (watch the cap)
4. Add Scatter Shot for Swarm waves (5, 10, 15...)
5. Have at least one level 3+ turret for Wave 10 Boss

**Economy Focus:**
- Don't spend every credit immediately
- Interest is free money every wave
- Milestone bonuses at waves 5, 10, 15, 20, 25

### Mid Game (Waves 26-50)

**Goals:** Push turrets to level 4-6, prepare for prestige

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Prioritize upgrading key turrets to level 4+ (major power spike)
2. Add specialized turrets: Cryo for control, Rail for shields
3. Build up credits for interest while maintaining defense
4. Prepare for Wave 50 prestige threshold

**Economy Focus:**
- Interest cap becomes important (upgrade Investment Returns)
- Wave 50 milestone = 2,500 bonus credits
- Balance spending with savings

---

### Late Game (Waves 51-80)

**Goals:** Counter advanced enemies, continue scaling

**New Threats:**
- Regenerators (wave 51): Need sustained DPS
- Splitters (wave 55): AoE for spawns
- Phasers (wave 60): High accuracy or AoE
- Phase Drones (wave 60): Avoid energy damage
- Pyro Tanks (wave 65): Avoid fire damage
- Nullifiers (wave 70): Shield breaking
- Adaptive (wave 75): Turret diversity

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Diversify turret types for resistances
2. Max out key turrets to level 6
3. Use powerups strategically on tough waves
4. Research Quantum Core for shield protection

---

### End Game (Waves 80+)

**Goals:** Survive Titans, counter anti-meta enemies

**Major Threats:**
- Titan (wave 80+): Huge HP, shield, costs 5 lives
- Void Shield (wave 100): Pierce immune
- Chrono Phaser (wave 105): Beam immune
- Inferno Carrier (wave 110): Fire resistant

**Survival Tips:**
1. Stock Quantum Immunity for Titan waves
2. Build diverse damage types (no single meta)
3. Use Slow Mobius to manage overwhelming waves
4. Keep The Nuke for emergencies
5. Turret Mastery at game start for best value

## Turret Synergies

### Frozen Target Setup
1. Cryo Emitter freezes enemy (3 hits)
2. Frozen enemies take 2x damage
3. Other turrets deal massive damage

### Pack Tactics Formation
1. Group Pulse Cannons together
2. Each nearby Pulse adds +8% damage
3. Maximum +24% with 3 adjacent Pulses

### Pull and Splash
1. Singularity pulls enemies together (+30% damage)
2. Plasma Mortar AoE hits clustered enemies
3. Massive group damage

### Slow + Rail Line
1. Temporal Field slows enemies to 30% speed
2. Rail Gun pierces through slowed group
3. +15% damage per pierce adds up

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Building Too Many Low-Level Turrets
**Problem:** Spreading credits thin across many weak turrets

**Solution:** Fewer turrets, higher upgrades. Level 4-6 turrets are far more efficient than many level 1s.

### 2. Ignoring Interest
**Problem:** Spending every credit immediately

**Solution:** Let credits build between waves. 5% interest is free income. Upgrade the cap.

### 3. Not Upgrading Interest Cap
**Problem:** Base 500 cap limits income scaling

**Solution:** Investment Returns upgrade is one of the best early purchases.

### 4. Single Turret Type Strategy
**Problem:** Building only one turret type

**Solution:** Late game enemies have resistances. Diversify to counter Adaptive, Phase Drone, etc.

### 5. Forgetting About Turret Placement
**Problem:** Random turret placement

**Solution:** Force enemies to walk through kill zones. Block paths strategically.

### 6. Hoarding Too Much
**Problem:** Sitting on massive credits while struggling to survive

**Solution:** Dead runs earn nothing. Spend enough to survive comfortably.

### 7. Ignoring Daily Rewards
**Problem:** Missing free Prestige Points

**Solution:** Log in daily for 10-45 PP. Streaks add up fast.

## Advanced Tips

### Sell/Rebuy Strategy
With max Salvage Master (+40% sell value):
- Total return: 75% + 40% = 115%
- Actually profit from selling!
- Enables repositioning and strategy changes

### Interest Optimization
- Interest applies before wave starts
- Spend credits AFTER wave starts if possible
- Wave Bonus upgrade + Interest = compound gains

### Prestige Timing
- Prestige at wave 50 = 0 bonus points from waves
- Each wave above 50 = 10 bonus PP
- But higher waves = more PP from score
- Balance: prestige when struggling, push when comfortable

### Research Priority
1. **Quantum Core** - Shield prevents surprise deaths
2. **Singularity** - Great control and damage amp
3. **MOAT** - Amazing for grouped enemies (watch for Pyro)

### Powerup Economy
- Turret Mastery and Large Cap at game START
- Quantum Immunity DURING Titan waves
- The Nuke as absolute LAST resort
