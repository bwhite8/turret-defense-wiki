## Your First Game

### The Goal
Protect your **reactor core** (center of the map) from enemy drones. Enemies spawn from the edges and walk toward the core. Each enemy that reaches the core costs you lives.

### Game Over
You lose when your lives reach 0. Your final score is based on waves survived, enemies killed, and credits earned.

## Understanding Turrets

Turrets have these key stats:

| Stat | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Cost** | Credits to place |
| **Damage** | Damage per hit |
| **Fire Rate** | Shots per second |
| **Range** | How far it can shoot |
| **Accuracy** | How well it predicts enemy movement |

### Upgrade System
- Turrets have 6 levels
- Each upgrade increases damage, fire rate, and range
- **Levels 4-6 have bigger bonuses** - worth investing in!
- Upgrade cost shown on selected turret

## Understanding Enemies

Different enemies have different behaviors:

| Type | Threat | How to Handle |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Scout** | Low HP, fast | Easy kills, don't worry |
| **Armored** | High HP, slow | Focus fire, let them soak damage |
| **Swarm** | Spawn in groups of 5 | AoE damage helps |
| **Shielded** | Has shield layer | Burn through shield first |
| **Heavy** | Mini-boss, very tanky | Focus all turrets |
| **Boss** | Every 10 waves, costs 3 lives | Top priority target! |

## Economy Basics

### Income Sources
1. **Kill rewards** - Each enemy killed gives credits
2. **Wave completion** - Bonus credits for finishing a wave
3. **Interest** - 5% of your credits each wave (up to 500)
4. **Milestone bonuses** - Extra credits at waves 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.

### Spending Tips
- Early game: Balance building and upgrading
- Mid game: Focus on upgrades (bigger power spikes)
- Don't hoard too much - turret power is better than bank interest

## What Happens When You Die?
