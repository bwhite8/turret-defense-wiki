## Damage Types

## Strategic Tips

1. **Upgrade over quantity** - One level 6 turret often beats three level 1 turrets
2. **Mix damage types** - Late game enemies have resistances
3. **Use synergies** - Pack tactics Pulse, frozen targets, temporal fields
4. **Position for piercing** - Line up Rail Gun shots through groups
5. **Protect investments** - Don't let enemies destroy your expensive turrets
