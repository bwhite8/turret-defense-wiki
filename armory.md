3. **Use powerups** during gameplay from the bottom bar
4. Each powerup has a **per-game limit** on how many times you can use it

## Powerup Efficiency

Credit boosts have intentionally decreasing PP efficiency at higher tiers (convenience tax):

| Powerup | Credits/PP |
|---------|-----------|
| Credit Boost 10K | 666 credits/PP |
| Credit Boost 50K | 833 credits/PP |
| Credit Boost 100K | 1,000 credits/PP |
| Credit Boost 500K | 1,250 credits/PP |

Higher tier boosts are more PP efficient but have stricter per-game limits.
